# Escort
This repository contains projects of Escort and Estag
Escort is a python-coded system that balanced speed and accuracy in tracking multiple animals, by integrating label-based computer vision with CNN-based object detection. Escort is based on 16-bit marker, EStag and searches EStags within prediction boxes generated by deep CNN and incorporated tag information into the Simple Online and Realtime Tracking (SORT).
